# StudentDropoutML

A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout.
